<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<div class="description"><div class="-rootscope-page -rootscope-inprog-page"><p>At any point in time there can be only one <code>code</code> or $apply operation in progress.
The stack trace of this error allows you to trace the origin of the currently executing $apply or $digest call.</p>
<p><code>code</code> or <code>code</code> are processing operational states of the Scope - data-structure in Angular that provides context for models and enables model mutation observation.</p>
<p>Trying to reenter a <code>code</code> or <code>code</code> while one of them is already in progress is typically a sign of programming error that needs to be fixed.</p>
<p>This error is often seen when interacting with an API that is sometimes sync and sometimes async.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre>pre</pre>
<p>The controller constructor is always instantiated from within an $apply cycle, so if the third-party component called our callback synchronously, we&#39;d be trying to enter the $apply again.</p>
<p>To resolve this type of issue, either fix the api to be always synchronous or asynchronous or wrap the call to the api with setTimeout call to make it always asynchronous.</p>
<p>Other situation that leads to this error is when you are trying to reuse a function to by using it as a callback for code that is called by various apis inside and outside of $apply.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre>pre</pre>
<p>The fix for the example above looks like this:</p>
<pre>pre</pre>
