<div class="migrating-from-10-to-12"><div class="migrating-from-1-0-to-1-2-page"><p>AngularJS version 1.2 introduces several breaking changes that may require changes to your
application&#39;s source code.</p>
<p>Although we try to avoid breaking changes, there are some cases where it is unavoidable.
AngularJS 1.2 has undergone a thourough security review to make applications safer by default,
which has driven many of these changes. Several new features, especially animations, would not
be possible without a few changes. Finally, some outstanding bugs were best fixed by changing
an existing API.</p>
<div class="alert alert-warning">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> AngularJS versions 1.1.x are considered &quot;experimental&quot; with breaking changes between minor releases.
Version 1.2 is the result of several versions on the 1.1 branch, and has a stable API.</p>

<p>If you have an application on 1.1 and want to migrate it to 1.2, everything in the guide
below should still apply, but you may want to consult the
<a href="https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md">changelog</a> as well.</p>

<h3 id="you-can-only-bind-one-expression-to">You can only bind one expression to <code>code</code> or <code>code</code></h3>
<p>With the exception of <code>code</code> and <code>code</code> elements, you cannot bind more than one expression to the

<p>This is one of several improvements to security introduces by Angular 1.2.</p>
<p>Concatenating expressions makes it hard to understand whether some combination of concatenated
values are unsafe to use and potentially subject to XSS vulnerabilities. To simplify the task of
auditing for XSS issues, we now require that a single expression be used for <code>code</code>
bindings such as bindings for <code>code</code>, <code>code</code>, etc.</p>

<h3 id="interpolations-inside-dom-event-handlers-are-now-disallowed">Interpolations inside DOM event handlers are now disallowed</h3>
<p>DOM event handlers execute arbitrary Javascript code. Using an interpolation for such handlers
means that the interpolated value is a JS string that is evaluated. Storing or generating such
strings is error prone and leads to XSS vulnerabilities. On the other hand, <code>code</code> and other
Angular specific event handlers evaluate Angular expressions in non-window (Scope) context which
makes them much safer.</p>

<h3 id="directives-cannot-end-with--start-or--end">Directives cannot end with -start or -end</h3>
<p>This change was necessary to enable multi-element directives. The best fix is to rename existing
directives so that they don&#39;t end with these suffixes.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/e46100f7097d9a8f174bdb9e15d4c6098395c3f2">e46100f7</a>.</p>
<h3 id="in-$q,-promisealways-has-been-renamed-promisefinally">In $q, promise.always has been renamed promise.finally</h3>
<p>The reason for this change is to align <code>code</code> with the <a href="https://github.com/kriskowal/q">Q promise
library</a>, despite the fact that this makes it a bit more difficult
to use with non-ES5 browsers, like IE8.</p>
<p><code>code</code> also goes well together with the <code>code</code> API that was added to <code>code</code> recently and is part
of the <a href="http://dom.spec.whatwg.org/">DOM promises standard</a>.</p>

<h3 id="ngmobile-is-now-ngtouch">ngMobile is now ngTouch</h3>
<p>Many touch-enabled devices are not mobile devices, so we decided to rename this module to better
reflect its concerns.</p>
<p>To migrate, replace all references to <code>code</code> with <code>code</code> and <code>code</code> with
<code>code</code>.</p>

<h3 id="$locationsearch-supports-multiple-keys">$location.search supports multiple keys</h3>
<p><a href="api/ng.$location#methods_search"><code>code</code></code></a> now supports multiple keys with the
same value provided that the values are stored in an array.</p>
<p>Before this change:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>code</code> only took the last key overwriting all the previous keys.</li>
<li><code>code</code> joined the keys together in a comma delimited string.</li>
</ul>
<p>This was deemed buggy behavior. If your server relied on this behavior then either the server
should be fixed, or a simple serialization of the array should be done on the client before
passing it to <code>code</code>.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/807394095b991357225a03d5fed81fea5c9a1abe">80739409</a>.</p>

<p><code>code</code> which has been moved from <code>code</code> module to the core <code>code</code> module.</p>
<p><code>code</code> provides <code>code</code> like
behavior (evaluate an expression and innerHTML the result into the DOM) when bound to the result
of <code>code</code>. When bound to a plain string, the string is sanitized via
<code>code</code> before being innerHTML&#39;d. If the <code>code</code> service isn&#39;t available (<code>code</code>
module is not loaded) and the bound expression evaluates to a value that is not trusted an
exception is thrown.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/dae694739b9581bea5dbc53522ec00d87b26ae55">dae69473</a>.</p>
<h3 id="form-names-that-are-expressions-are-evaluated">Form names that are expressions are evaluated</h3>

<p>And if you are accessing the form from your controller:</p>
<p>Before:</p>
<pre>pre</pre>
<p>After:</p>
<pre>pre</pre>
<p>This makes it possible to access a form from a controller using the new &quot;controller as&quot; syntax.
Supporting the previous behavior offers no benefit.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/8ea802a1d23ad8ecacab892a3a451a308d9c39d7">8ea802a1</a>.</p>
<h3 id="hasownproperty-disallowed-as-an-input-name">hasOwnProperty disallowed as an input name</h3>
<p>Inputs with name equal to <code>code</code> are not allowed inside form or ngForm directives.</p>
<p>Before, inputs whose name was &quot;hasOwnProperty&quot; were quietly ignored and not added to the scope.
Now a badname exception is thrown. Using &quot;hasOwnProperty&quot; for an input name would be very unusual
and bad practice. To migrate, change your input name.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/7a586e5c19f3d1ecc3fefef084ce992072ee7f60">7a586e5c</a>.</p>
<h3 id="directives-order-of-postlink-functions-reversed">Directives: Order of postLink functions reversed</h3>
<p>The order of postLink fn is now mirror opposite of the order in which corresponding preLinking and compile functions execute.</p>
<p>Previously the compile/link fns executed in order, sorted by priority:</p>
<table class="table table-bordered table-striped code-table">
<thead>
<tr>
  <th>#</th>
  <th>Step</th>
  <th align="center">Old Sort Order</th>

</table>

<p><small>&quot;High → Low&quot; here refers to the <code>code</code> option of a directive.</small></p>
<p>Very few directives in practice rely on the order of postLinking functions (unlike on the order
of compile functions), so in the rare case of this change affecting an existing directive, it might
be necessary to convert it to a preLinking function or give it negative priority.</p>
<p>You can look at <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/31f190d4d53921d32253ba80d9ebe57d6c1de82b">the diff of this

<h3 id="directive-priority">Directive priority</h3>
<p>the priority of ngRepeat, ngSwitchWhen, ngIf, ngInclude and ngView has changed. This could affect directives that explicitly specify their priority.</p>
<p>In order to make ngRepeat, ngSwitchWhen, ngIf, ngInclude and ngView work together in all common scenarios their directives are being adjusted to achieve the following precendence:</p>

<h3 id="ngscenario">ngScenario</h3>
<p>browserTrigger now uses an eventData object instead of direct parameters for mouse events.
To migrate, place the <code>code</code>,<code>code</code> and <code>code</code> parameters inside of an object and place that as the
third parameter for the browserTrigger function.</p>

<h3 id="nginclude-and-ngview-replace-its-entire-element-on-update">ngInclude and ngView replace its entire element on update</h3>
<p>Previously <code>code</code> and <code>code</code> only updated its element&#39;s content. Now these directives will
recreate the element every time a new content is included.</p>
<p>This ensures that a single rootElement for all the included contents always exists, which makes
definition of css styles for animations much easier.</p>

<h3 id="urls-are-now-sanitized-against-a-whitelist">URLs are now sanitized against a whitelist</h3>
<p>A whitelist configured via <code>code</code> can be used to configure what URLs are considered safe.
By default all common protocol prefixes are whitelisted including <code>code</code> URIs with mime types <code>code</code>.

<h3 id="isolate-scope-only-exposed-to-directives-with-property">Isolate scope only exposed to directives with <code>code</code> property</h3>
<p>Directives without isolate scope do not get the isolate scope from an isolate directive on the

from within the isolate scope), change the isolate directive to use scope locals to pass these explicitly.</p>

<p><strong>Reverted</strong>: This breaking change has been reverted in 1.2.1, and so can be ignored if you&#39;re using <strong>version 1.2.1 or higher</strong></p>
</div>

<p>This change introduces the notion of &quot;private&quot; properties (properties
whose names begin and/or end with an underscore) on the scope chain.
These properties will not be available to Angular expressions (i.e. {{
}} interpolation in templates and strings passed to <code>code</code>)  They are
freely available to JavaScript code (as before).</p>
<p><strong>Motivation</strong></p>
<p>Angular expressions execute in a limited context. They do not have
direct access to the global scope, <code>code</code>, <code>code</code> or the Function
constructor. However, they have direct access to names/properties on
the scope chain. It has been a long standing best practice to keep
sensitive APIs outside of the scope chain (in a closure or your
controller.) That&#39;s easier said that done for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>JavaScript does not have a notion of private properties so if you need
someone on the scope chain for JavaScript use, you also expose it to
Angular expressions</li>
<li>The new <code>code</code> syntax that&#39;s now in increased usage exposes the
entire controller on the scope chain greatly increaing the exposed surface.</li>
</ol>
<p>Though Angular expressions are written and controlled by the developer, they:</p>
<ol>
<li>Typically deal with user input</li>
<li>Don&#39;t get the kind of test coverage that JavaScript code would</li>
</ol>
<p>This commit provides a way, via a naming convention, to allow restricting properties from
controllers/scopes. This means Angular expressions can access only those properties that
are actually needed by the expressions.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/3d6a89e8888b14ae5cb5640464e12b7811853c7e">3d6a89e8</a>.</p>
<h3 id="you-cannot-bind-to-select[multiple]">You cannot bind to select[multiple]</h3>
<p>Switching between <code>code</code> and <code>code</code> has always been odd due to browser quirks.
This feature never worked with two-way data-binding so it&#39;s not expected that anyone is using it.</p>
<p>If you are interested in properly adding this feature, please submit a pull request on Github.</p>
