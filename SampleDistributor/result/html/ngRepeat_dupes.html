<div class="description"><div class="ngrepeat-page ngrepeat-dupes-page"><p>Occurs if there are duplicate keys in an <a href="api/ng.directive:ngRepeat"><code>code</code></a> expression.  Duplicate keys are banned because AngularJS uses keys to associate DOM nodes with items.</p>
<p>By default, collections are keyed by reference which is desirable for most common models but can be problematic for primitive types that are interned (share references).</p>
<p>For example the issue can be triggered by this <em>invalid</em> code:</p>
<pre>pre</pre>
<p>To resolve this error either ensure that the items in the collection have unique identity or use the <code>code</code> syntax to specify how to track the association between models and DOM.</p>
<p>To resolve the example above can be resolved by using <code>code</code>, which will cause the items to be keyed by their position in the array instead of their value:</p>
<pre>pre</pre>
