<a href="http://github.com/angular/angular.js/edit/master/docs/content/guide/concepts.ngdoc" class="improve-docs btn btn-primary"><i class="icon-edit"> </i> Improve this doc</a><h1><code>code</code></code></a> attribute, which is linked to a directive that automatically
initializes our application. Angular also defines a directive for the <a href="api/ng.directive:input"><code>code</code></code></a>
element that adds extra behavior to the element. E.g. it is able to automatically validate that the entered
text is non empty by evaluating the <code>code</code> attribute.
The <a href="api/ng.directive:ngModel"><code>code</code></code></a> directive stores/updates
the value of the input field into/from a variable and shows the validation state of the input field by
adding css classes. In the example we use these css classes to mark an empty input field with a red border.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<strong>Custom directives to access the DOM</strong>: In Angular, the only place where an application touches the DOM is
 within directives. This is good as artifacts that access the DOM are hard to test.
 If you need to access the DOM directly you should write a custom directive for this. The
 <a href="guide/directive">directives guide</a> explains how to do this.
</div>

<p>The second kind of new markup are the double curly braces <code>code</code>:
When the compiler encounters this markup, it will replace it with the evaluated value of the markup.
An <a name="expression">&quot;<a href="guide/expression">expression</a>&quot;</a> in a template is a JavaScript-like code snippet that allows
to read and write variables. Note that those variables are not global variables.
Just like variables in a JavaScript function live in a scope,
Angular provides a <a name="scope">&quot;<a href="guide/scope">scope</a>&quot;</a> for the variables accessible to expressions.
The values that are stored in variables on the scope are referred to as the <a name="model">&quot;model&quot;</a>
in the rest of the documentation.
Applied to the example above, the markup directs Angular to &quot;take the data we got from the input widgets
and multiply them together&quot;.</p>
<p>The example above also contains a <a name="filter">&quot;<a href="guide/filter">filter</a>&quot;</a>.
A filter formats the value of an expression for display to the user.
In the example above, the filter <a href="api/ng.filter:currency"><code>code</code></code></a> formats a number
into an output that looks like money.</p>
<p>The important thing in the example is that angular provides <em>live</em> bindings:
Whenever the input values change, the value of the expressions are automatically
recalculated and the DOM is updated with their values.
The concept behind this is <a name="databinding">&quot;<a href="guide/databinding">two-way data binding</a>&quot;</a>.</p>
<h2 id="adding-ui-logic-controllers">Adding UI logic: Controllers</h2>
<p>Let&#39;s add some more logic to the example that allows us to enter and calculate the costs in
different currencies and also pay the invoice.</p>
<h3 id="adding-ui-logic-controllers_source">Source</h3>
<div source-edit="invoice1" source-edit-deps="a.js" source-edit-html="index.html-187" source-edit-css="" source-edit-js="a.js" source-edit-json="" source-edit-unit="" source-edit-scenario="" source-edit-protractor=""></div>
<div class="tabbable"><div class="tab-pane" title="index.html">

<script>script</script>
</div>
</div><h3 id="adding-ui-logic-controllers_demo">Demo</h3>
<div class="well doc-example-live animate-container" ng-embed-app="invoice1" ng-set-html="index.html-187" ng-eval-javascript="a.js"></div>
<p>What changed?</p>
<p>First, there is a new JavaScript file that contains a so called <a name="controller">&quot;<a href="guide/controller">controller</a>&quot;</a>.
More exactly, the file contains a constructor function that creates the actual controller instance.
The purpose of controllers is to expose variables and functionality to expressions and directives.</p>
<p>Besides the new file that contains the controller code we also added a
<a href="api/ng.directive:ngController"><code>code</code></code></a> directive to the HTML.
This directive tells angular that the new <code>code</code> is responsible for the element with the directive
and all of the element&#39;s children.
The syntax <code>code</code> tells Angular to instantiate the controller
and save it in the variable <code>code</code> in the current scope.</p>
<p>We also changed all expressions in the page to read and write variables within that
controller instance by prefixing them with <code>code</code> . The possible currencies are defined in the controller
and added to the template using <a href="api/ng.directive:ngRepeat"><code>code</code></code></a>.
As the controller contains a <code>code</code> function
we are also able to bind the result of that function to the DOM using <code>code</code>.</p>
<p>Again, this binding is live, i.e. the DOM will be automatically updated
whenever the result of the function changes.
The button to pay the invoice uses the directive <a href="api/ng.directive:ngClick"><code>code</code></code></a>. This will evaluate the
corresponding expression whenever the button is clicked.</p>
<p>In the new JavaScript file we are also creating a <a href="guide/concepts#module">module</a>
at which we register the controller. We will talk about modules in the next section.</p>
<p>The following graphic shows how everything works together after we introduced the controller:</p>
<p><img style="padding-left: 3em; padding-bottom: 1em;" src="a.png"></p>
<h2 id="view-independent-business-logic-services">View independent business logic: Services</h2>
<p>Right now, the <code>code</code> contains all logic of our example. When the application grows it
is a good practice to move view independent logic from the controller into a so called
<a name="service">&quot;<a href="guide/dev_guide.services">service</a>&quot;</a>, so it can be reused by other parts
of the application as well. Later on, we could also change that service to load the exchange rates
from the web, e.g. by calling the Yahoo Finance API, without changing the controller.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s refactor our example and move the currency conversion into a service in another file:</p>

<div source-edit="invoice2" source-edit-deps="a.js" source-edit-html="index.html-188" source-edit-css="" source-edit-js="a.js" source-edit-json="" source-edit-unit="" source-edit-scenario="" source-edit-protractor=""></div>
<div class="tabbable"><div class="tab-pane" title="index.html">
<pre>pre</pre>

</div>
<div class="tab-pane" title="a.js">
<pre>pre</pre>
<script>script</script>
</div>
<div class="tab-pane" title="a.js">

<script>script</script>
</div>
</div><h3 id="accessing-the-backend_demo">Demo</h3>
<div class="well doc-example-live animate-container" ng-embed-app="invoice3" ng-set-html="index.html-189" ng-eval-javascript="a.js"></div>
<p>What changed?
Our <code>code</code> service of the <code>code</code> module now uses the
<a href="api/ng.$http"><code>code</code></a> service, a builtin service provided by Angular
for accessing the backend. It is a wrapper around <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest"><code>code</code></a>
and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP">JSONP</a> transports. Details can be found in the api docs of that service.</p>
