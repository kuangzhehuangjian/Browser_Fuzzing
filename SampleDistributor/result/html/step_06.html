<a href="http://github.com/angular/angular.js/edit/master/docs/content/tutorial/step_06.ngdoc" class="improve-docs btn btn-primary"><i class="icon-edit"> </i> Improve this doc</a><h1><code>code</code> file contains unique ids and image urls for each of the phones. The
urls point to the <code>code</code> directory.</p>
<p><strong><code>code</code></strong> (sample snippet):
<pre>pre</pre>
<h3 id="template">Template</h3>
<p><strong><code>code</code>:</strong>
<pre>pre</pre>
<p>To dynamically generate links that will in the future lead to phone detail pages, we used the
now-familiar double-curly brace binding in the <code>code</code> attribute values. In step 2, we added the
<code>code</code> binding as the element content. In this step the <code>code</code> binding is used in
the element attribute.</p>
<p>We also added phone images next to each record using an image tag with the <a href="api/ng.directive:ngSrc"><code>code</code></a> directive. That directive prevents the
browser from treating the angular <code>code</code> markup literally, and initiating a request to
invalid url <code>code</code>, which it would have done if we had only
specified an attribute binding in a regular <code>code</code> attribute (<code>code</code>).
Using the <code>code</code> directive prevents the browser from making an http request to an invalid location.</p>
<h3 id="test">Test</h3>
<p><strong><code>code</code></strong>:
<pre>pre</pre>
<p>We added a new end-to-end test to verify that the app is generating correct links to the phone
views that we will implement in the upcoming steps.</p>
<p>You can now rerun <code>code</code> or refresh the browser tab with the end-to-end test
runner to see the tests run, or you can see them running on <a href="http://angular.github.com/angular-phonecat/step-6/test/e2e/runner.html">Angular&#39;s server</a>.</p>
<h2 id="experiments">Experiments</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Replace the <code>code</code> directive with a plain old <code>code</code> attribute. Using tools such as Firebug,
or Chrome&#39;s Web Inspector, or inspecting the webserver access logs, confirm that the app is indeed
making an extraneous request to <code>code</code> (or
<code>code</code>).</p>
<p>The issue here is that the browser will fire a request for that invalid image address as soon as
it hits the <code>code</code> tag, which is before Angular has a chance to evaluate the expression and inject
the valid address.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Now that you have added phone images and links, go to <a href="tutorial/step_07">step 7</a> to learn about Angular
layout templates and how Angular makes it easy to create applications that have multiple views.</p>
