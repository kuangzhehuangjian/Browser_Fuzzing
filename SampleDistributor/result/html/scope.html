model. It is an execution context for <a href="guide/expression">expressions</a>. Scopes are
arranged in hierarchical structure which mimic the DOM structure of the application. Scopes can
watch <a href="guide/expression">expressions</a> and propagate events.</p>
<h3 id="what-are-scopes_scope-characteristics">Scope characteristics</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Scopes provide APIs (<a href="api/ng.$rootScope.Scope#methods_$watch"><code>code</code></a>) to observe
model mutations.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Scopes provide APIs (<a href="api/ng.$rootScope.Scope#methods_$apply"><code>code</code></a>) to
propagate any model changes through the system into the view from outside of the &quot;Angular
realm&quot; (controllers, services, Angular event handlers).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Scopes can be nested to limit access to the properties of application components while providing
access to shared model properties. Nested scopes are either &quot;child scopes&quot; or &quot;isolate scopes&quot;.
A &quot;child scope&quot; (prototypically) inherits properties from its parent scope. An &quot;isolate scope&quot;
does not. See <a href="guide/directive#creating-custom-directives_demo_isolating-the-scope-of-a-directive">isolated     scopes</a> for more information.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Scopes provide context against which <a href="guide/expression">expressions</a> are evaluated. For
example <code>code</code> expression is meaningless, unless it is evaluated against a specific
scope which defines the <code>code</code> property.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-are-scopes_scope-as-data-model">Scope as Data-Model</h3>
<p>Scope is the glue between application controller and the view. During the template <a href="guide/compiler">linking</a> phase the <a href="api/ng.$compileProvider#methods_directive"><code>code</code></a> set up
<a href="api/ng.$rootScope.Scope#methods_$watch"><code>code</code></code></a> expressions on the scope. The
<code>code</code> allows the directives to be notified of property changes, which allows the directive to
render the updated value to the DOM.</p>
<p>Both controllers and directives have reference to the scope, but not to each other. This
arrangement isolates the controller from the directive as well as from DOM. This is an important
point since it makes the controllers view agnostic, which greatly improves the testing story of
the applications.</p>

<p>In the above example notice that the <code>code</code> assigns <code>code</code> to the <code>code</code> property of
the scope. The scope then notifies the <code>code</code> of the assignment, which then renders the input
with username pre-filled. This demonstrates how a controller can write data into the scope.</p>
<p>Similarly the controller can assign behavior to scope as seen by the <code>code</code> method, which is
invoked when the user clicks on the &#39;greet&#39; button. The <code>code</code> method can read the <code>code</code>
property and create a <code>code</code> property. This demonstrates that the properties on scope update
automatically when they are bound to HTML input widgets.</p>
<p>Logically the rendering of <code>code</code> involves:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>retrieval of the scope associated with DOM node where <code>code</code> is defined in template.
In this example this is the same scope as the scope which was passed into <code>code</code>. (We
will discuss scope hierarchies later.)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Evaluate the <code>code</code> <a href="guide/expression">expression</a> against the scope retrieved above,
and assign the result to the text of the enclosing DOM element.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can think of the scope and its properties as the data which is used to render the view. The
scope is the single source-of-truth for all things view related.</p>
<p>From a testability point of view, the separation of the controller and the view is desirable, because it allows us
to test the behavior without being distracted by the rendering details.</p>

<h3 id="what-are-scopes_scope-hierarchies">Scope Hierarchies</h3>
<p>Each Angular application has exactly one <a href="api/ng.$rootScope"><code>code</code></a>, but
may have several child scopes.</p>
<p>The application can have multiple scopes, because some <a href="guide/directive">directives</a> create
new child scopes (refer to directive documentation to see which directives create new scopes).
When new scopes are created, they are added as children of their parent scope. This creates a tree
structure which parallels the DOM where they&#39;re attached</p>
<p>When Angular evaluates <code>code</code>, it first looks at the scope associated with the given
element for the <code>code</code> property. If no such property is found, it searches the parent scope
and so on until the root scope is reached. In JavaScript this behavior is known as prototypical
inheritance, and child scopes prototypically inherit from their parents.</p>
<p>This example illustrates scopes in application, and prototypical inheritance of properties. The example is followed by
a diagram depicting the scope boundaries.</p>

<h3 id="what-are-scopes_scope-life-cycle">Scope Life Cycle</h3>
<p>The normal flow of a browser receiving an event is that it executes a corresponding JavaScript
callback. Once the callback completes the browser re-renders the DOM and returns to waiting for
more events.</p>
<p>When the browser calls into JavaScript the code executes outside the Angular execution context,
which means that Angular is unaware of model modifications. To properly process model
modifications the execution has to enter the Angular execution context using the <a href="api/ng.$rootScope.Scope#methods_$apply"><code>code</code></code></a> method. Only model modifications which
execute inside the <code>code</code> method will be properly accounted for by Angular. For example if a
directive listens on DOM events, such as <a href="api/ng.directive:ngClick"><code>code</code></code></a> it must evaluate the
expression inside the <code>code</code> method.</p>
<p>After evaluating the expression, the <code>code</code> method performs a <a href="api/ng.$rootScope.Scope#methods_$digest"><code>code</code></code></a>. In the $digest phase the scope examines all
of the <code>code</code> expressions and compares them with the previous value. This dirty checking is done
asynchronously. This means that assignment such as <code>code</code> will not
immediately cause a <code>code</code> to be notified, instead the <code>code</code> notification is delayed until
the <code>code</code> phase. This delay is desirable, since it coalesces multiple model updates into one
<code>code</code> notification as well as it guarantees that during the <code>code</code> notification no other
<code>code</code>es are running. If a <code>code</code> changes the value of the model, it will force additional
<code>code</code> cycle.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Creation</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="api/ng.$rootScope"><code>code</code></a> is created during the application
bootstrap by the <a href="api/AUTO.$injector"><code>code</code></a>. During template
linking, some directives create new child scopes.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Watcher registration</strong></p>
<p>During template linking directives register <a href="api/ng.$rootScope.Scope#methods_$watch"><code>code</code></a> on the scope. These watches will be
used to propagate model values to the DOM.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Model mutation</strong></p>
<p>For mutations to be properly observed, you should make them only within the <a href="api/ng.$rootScope.Scope#methods_$apply"><code>code</code></a>. (Angular APIs do this
implicitly, so no extra <code>code</code> call is needed when doing synchronous work in controllers,
or asynchronous work with <a href="api/ng.$http"><code>code</code></a>, <a href="api/ng.$timeout"><code>code</code></a>
or <a href="api/ng.$interval"><code>code</code></a> services.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Mutation observation</strong></p>
<p>At the end <code>code</code>, Angular performs a <a href="api/ng.$rootScope.Scope#methods_$digest"><code>code</code></a> cycle on the root scope, which then propagates throughout all child scopes. During
the <code>code</code> cycle, all <code>code</code>ed expressions or functions are checked for model mutation
and if a mutation is detected, the <code>code</code> listener is called.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Scope destruction</strong></p>
<p>When child scopes are no longer needed, it is the responsibility of the child scope creator
to destroy them via <a href="api/ng.$rootScope.Scope#methods_$destroy"><code>code</code></a>
API. This will stop propagation of <code>code</code> calls into the child scope and allow for memory
used by the child scope models to be reclaimed by the garbage collector.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="what-are-scopes_scope-life-cycle_scopes-and-directives">Scopes and Directives</h4>
<p>During the compilation phase, the <a href="guide/compiler">compiler</a> matches <a href="api/ng.$compileProvider#methods_directive"><code>code</code></a> against the DOM template. The directives
usually fall into one of two categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Observing <a href="api/ng.$compileProvider#methods_directive"><code>code</code></a>, such as
double-curly expressions <code>code</code>, register listeners using the <a href="api/ng.$rootScope.Scope#methods_$watch"><code>code</code></a> method. This type of directive needs
to be notified whenever the expression changes so that it can update the view.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Listener directives, such as <a href="api/ng.directive:ngClick"><code>code</code></a>, register a listener with the DOM. When the DOM listener fires, the directive
executes the associated expression and updates the view using the <a href="api/ng.$rootScope.Scope#methods_$apply"><code>code</code></a> method.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When an external event (such as a user action, timer or XHR) is received, the associated <a href="guide/expression">expression</a> must be applied to the scope through the <a href="api/ng.$rootScope.Scope#methods_$apply"><code>code</code></a> method so that all listeners are updated
correctly.</p>
<h4 id="what-are-scopes_scope-life-cycle_directives-that-create-scopes">Directives that Create Scopes</h4>
<p>In most cases, <a href="api/ng.$compileProvider#methods_directive"><code>code</code></a> and scopes interact
but do not create new instances of scope. However, some directives, such as <a href="api/ng.directive:ngController"><code>code</code></a> and <a href="api/ng.directive:ngRepeat"><code>code</code></a>, create new child scopes
and attach the child scope to the corresponding DOM element. You can retrieve a scope for any DOM
element by using an <code>code</code> method call.
See the <a href="guide/directive#creating-custom-directives_demo_isolating-the-scope-of-a-directive">directives guide</a> for more information about isolate scopes.</p>
<h4 id="what-are-scopes_scope-life-cycle_controllers-and-scopes">Controllers and Scopes</h4>
<p>Scopes and controllers interact with each other in the following situations:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Controllers use scopes to expose controller methods to templates (see <a href="api/ng.directive:ngController"><code>code</code></a>).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Controllers define methods (behavior) that can mutate the model (properties on the scope).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Controllers may register <a href="api/ng.$rootScope.Scope#methods_$watch"><code>code</code></a> on
the model. These watches execute immediately after the controller behavior executes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>See the <a href="api/ng.directive:ngController"><code>code</code></a> for more
information.</p>
<h4 id="what-are-scopes_scope-life-cycle_scope-performance-considerations">Scope <code>code</code> Performance Considerations</h4>
<p>Dirty checking the scope for property changes is a common operation in Angular and for this reason
the dirty checking function must be efficient. Care should be taken that the dirty checking
function does not do any DOM access, as DOM access is orders of magnitude slower than property
access on JavaScript object.</p>
<h3 id="what-are-scopes_integration-with-the-browser-event-loop">Integration with the browser event loop</h3>
<p><img class="pull-right" style="padding-left: 3em; padding-bottom: 1em;" src="a.png"></p>
<p>The diagram and the example below describe how Angular interacts with the browser&#39;s event loop.</p>
<ol>
<li>The browser&#39;s event-loop waits for an event to arrive. An event is a user interaction, timer event,
or network event (response from a server).</li>
<li>The event&#39;s callback gets executed. This enters the JavaScript context. The callback can
 modify the DOM structure.</li>
<li>Once the callback executes, the browser leaves the JavaScript context and
re-renders the view based on DOM changes.</li>
</ol>
<p>Angular modifies the normal JavaScript flow by providing its own event processing loop. This
splits the JavaScript into classical and Angular execution context. Only operations which are
applied in Angular execution context will benefit from Angular data-binding, exception handling,
property watching, etc... You can also use $apply() to enter Angular execution context from JavaScript. Keep in
mind that in most places (controllers, services) $apply has already been called for you by the
directive which is handling the event. An explicit call to $apply is needed only when
implementing custom event callbacks, or when working with third-party library callbacks.</p>
<ol>
<li>Enter Angular execution context by calling <a href="guide/scope">scope</a><code>code</code><a href="api/ng.$rootScope.Scope#methods_$apply"><code>code</code></a><code>code</code>. Where <code>code</code> is
the work you wish to do in Angular execution context.</li>
<li>Angular executes the <code>code</code>, which typically modifies application state.</li>
<li>Angular enters the <a href="api/ng.$rootScope.Scope#methods_$digest"><code>code</code></a> loop. The
loop is made up of two smaller loops which process <a href="api/ng.$rootScope.Scope#methods_$evalasync"><code>code</code></a> queue and the <a href="api/ng.$rootScope.Scope#methods_$watch"><code>code</code></a> list. The <a href="api/ng.$rootScope.Scope#methods_$digest"><code>code</code></a> loop keeps iterating until the model
stabilizes, which means that the <a href="api/ng.$rootScope.Scope#methods_$evalasync"><code>code</code></a> queue is empty and the <a href="api/ng.$rootScope.Scope#methods_$watch"><code>code</code></a> list does not detect any changes.</li>
<li>The <a href="api/ng.$rootScope.Scope#methods_$evalasync"><code>code</code></a> queue is used to
schedule work which needs to occur outside of current stack frame, but before the browser&#39;s
view render. This is usually done with <code>code</code>, but the <code>code</code> approach
suffers from slowness and may cause view flickering since the browser renders the view after
each event.</li>
<li>The <a href="api/ng.$rootScope.Scope#methods_$watch"><code>code</code></a> list is a set of expressions
which may have changed since last iteration. If a change is detected then the <code>code</code>
function is called which typically updates the DOM with the new value.</li>
<li>Once the Angular <a href="api/ng.$rootScope.Scope#methods_$digest"><code>code</code></a> loop finishes
the execution leaves the Angular and JavaScript context. This is followed by the browser
re-rendering the DOM to reflect any changes.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is the explanation of how the <code>code</code> example achieves the data-binding effect when the
user enters text into the text field.</p>
<ol>
<li>During the compilation phase:<ol>
<li>the <a href="api/ng.directive:ngModel"><code>code</code></a> and <a href="api/ng.directive:input"><code>code</code></a> <a href="guide/directive">directive</a> set up a <code>code</code> listener on the <code>code</code> control.</li>
<li>the <a href="api/ng.$interpolate"><code>code</code></a> interpolation
sets up a <a href="api/ng.$rootScope.Scope#methods_$watch"><code>code</code></a> to be notified of
<code>code</code> changes.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>During the runtime phase:<ol>
<li>Pressing an &#39;<code>code</code>&#39; key causes the browser to emit a <code>code</code> event on the input control.</li>
<li>The <a href="api/ng.directive:input"><code>code</code></a> directive
captures the change to the input&#39;s value and calls <a href="api/ng.$rootScope.Scope#methods_$apply"><code>code</code></a><code>code</code> to update the
application model inside the Angular execution context.</li>
<li>Angular applies the <code>code</code> to the model.</li>
<li>The <a href="api/ng.$rootScope.Scope#methods_$digest"><code>code</code></a> loop begins</li>
<li>The <a href="api/ng.$rootScope.Scope#methods_$watch"><code>code</code></a> list detects a change
on the <code>code</code> property and notifies the <a href="api/ng.$interpolate"><code>code</code></a> interpolation, which in turn updates the DOM.</li>
<li>Angular exits the execution context, which in turn exits the <code>code</code> event and with it
the JavaScript execution context.</li>
<li>The browser re-renders the view with update text.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
