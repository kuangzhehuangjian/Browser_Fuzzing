<pre>pre</pre>
</li>
<li><p>you <strong>do not</strong> use custom element tags such as <code>code</code> (use the attribute version
<code>code</code> instead), or</p>
</li>
<li><p>if you <strong>do use</strong> custom element tags, then you must take these steps to make IE 8 and below happy:
<pre>pre</pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The <strong>important</strong> parts are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>code</code> - <em>namespace</em> - you need one namespace for each custom tag you are planning on
using.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>code</code> - <em>creation of custom tag names</em> - Since this is an
issue only for older version of IE you need to load it conditionally. For each tag which does
not have namespace and which is not defined in HTML you need to pre-declare it to make IE
happy.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="long-version">Long Version</h2>
<p>IE has issues with element tag names which are not standard HTML tag names. These fall into two
categories, and each category has its own fix.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If the tag name starts with <code>code</code> prefix then it is considered an XML namespace and must
have corresponding namespace declaration on <code>code</code></p>
</li>
<li><p>If the tag has no <code>code</code> but it is not a standard HTML tag, then it must be pre-created using
<code>code</code></p>
</li>
<li><p>If you are planning on styling the custom tag with CSS selectors, then it must be
pre-created using <code>code</code> regardless of XML namespace.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="long-version_the-good-news">The Good News</h3>
<p>The good news is that these restrictions only apply to element tag names, and not to element
attribute names. So this requires no special handling in IE: <code>code</code>.</p>
<h3 id="long-version_what-happens-if-i-fail-to-do-this">What happens if I fail to do this?</h3>
<p>Suppose you have HTML with unknown tag <code>code</code> (this could also be <code>code</code> or <code>code</code> with same
result):</p>
<pre>pre</pre>
<p>It should parse into the following DOM:</p>
<pre>pre</pre>
<p>The expected behavior is that the <code>code</code> element has a child element <code>code</code>, which in turn has
the text <code>code</code>.</p>
<p>But this is not what IE does (if the above fixes are not included):</p>
<pre>pre</pre>
<p>In IE, the behavior is that the <code>code</code> element has three children:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>A self closing <code>code</code>. Example of self closing tag is <code>code</code>. The trailing <code>code</code> is optional,
but the <code>code</code> tag is not allowed to have any children, and browsers consider <code>code</code> as three siblings not a <code>code</code> with <code>code</code> as child.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A text node with <code>code</code>. This should have been a child of <code>code</code> above, not a sibling.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A corrupt self closing <code>code</code>. This is corrupt since element names are not allowed to have
the <code>code</code> character. Furthermore this closing element should not be part of the DOM since it is
only used to delineate the structure of the DOM.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="long-version_css-styling-of-custom-tag-names">CSS Styling of Custom Tag Names</h3>
<p>To make CSS selectors work with custom elements, the custom element name must be pre-created with 
<code>code</code> regardless of XML namespace.</p>
<pre>pre</pre>
