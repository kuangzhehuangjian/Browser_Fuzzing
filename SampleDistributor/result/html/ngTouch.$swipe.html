<div><h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<div class="description"><div class="ngtouch-swipe-page"><p>The <code>code</code> service is a service that abstracts the messier details of hold-and-drag swipe
behavior, to make implementing swipe-related directives more convenient.</p>
<p>Requires the <a href="api/ngTouch"><code>code</code></a> module to be installed.</p>
<p><code>code</code> is used by the <code>code</code> and <code>code</code> directives in <code>code</code>, and by
<code>code</code> in a separate component.</p>
<h3 id="description_usage">Usage</h3>
<p>The <code>code</code> service is an object with a single method: <code>code</code>. <code>code</code> takes an element
which is to be watched for swipes, and an object with four handler functions. See the
documentation for <code>code</code> below.</p>

<div class="bind"><div class="ngtouch-swipe-bind-page"><p>The main method of <code>code</code>. It takes an element to be watched for swipe motions, and an
object containing event handlers.</p>
<p>The four events are <code>code</code>, <code>code</code>, <code>code</code>, and <code>code</code>. <code>code</code>, <code>code</code>, and <code>code</code>
receive as a parameter a coordinates object of the form <code>code</code>.</p>
<p><code>code</code> is called on either <code>code</code> or <code>code</code>. After this event, <code>code</code> is
watching for <code>code</code> or <code>code</code> events. These events are ignored until the total
distance moved in either dimension exceeds a small threshold.</p>
<p>Once this threshold is exceeded, either the horizontal or vertical delta is greater.
- If the horizontal distance is greater, this is a swipe and <code>code</code> and <code>code</code> events follow.
- If the vertical distance is greater, this is a scroll, and we let the browser take over.
  A <code>code</code> event is sent.</p>
<p><code>code</code> is called on <code>code</code> and <code>code</code> after the above logic has determined that
a swipe is in progress.</p>
<p><code>code</code> is called when a swipe is successfully completed with a <code>code</code> or <code>code</code>.</p>
<p><code>code</code> is called either on a <code>code</code> from the browser, or when we begin scrolling
as described above.</p>
