2. Look for it in a well-known place, also known as a global singleton.
3. Ask a registry (also known as service registry) for it. (But how do you get a hold of
the registry? Most likely by looking it up in a well known place. See #2.)
4. Expect it to be handed to you.</p>
<p>Out of the four options in the list above, only the last one is testable. Let&#39;s look at why:</p>
<h4 id="it-is-all-about-not-mixing-concerns_dependency-injection_using-the-operator">Using the <code>code</code> operator</h4>
<p>While there is nothing wrong with the <code>code</code> operator fundamentally, a problem arises when calling <code>code</code>
on a constructor. This permanently binds the call site to the type. For example, lets say that we try to
instantiate an <code>code</code> that will retrieve data from the server.</p>
<pre>pre</pre>
<p>A problem surfaces in tests when we would like to instantiate a <code>code</code> that would
allow us to return fake data and simulate network failures. By calling <code>code</code> we are
permanently bound to the actual XHR and there is no  way to replace it. Yes, we could monkey
patch, but that is a bad idea for many reasons which are outside the scope of this document.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s an example of how the class above becomes hard to test when resorting to monkey patching:
<pre>pre</pre>
<h4 id="it-is-all-about-not-mixing-concerns_dependency-injection_global-look-up">Global look-up:</h4>
<p>Another way to approach the problem is to look for the service in a well-known location.</p>
<pre>pre</pre>
<p>While no new dependency instance is created, it is fundamentally the same as <code>code</code> in
that no  way exists to intercept the call to <code>code</code> for testing purposes, other then
through monkey patching. The basic issue for testing is that a global variable needs to be mutated in
order to replace it with call to a mock method. For further explanation of why this is bad see: <a href="http://misko.hevery.com/code-reviewers-guide/flaw-brittle-global-state-singletons/">Brittle Global State &amp; Singletons</a></p>
<p>The class above is hard to test since we have to change the global state:
<pre>pre</pre>
<h4 id="it-is-all-about-not-mixing-concerns_dependency-injection_service-registry">Service Registry:</h4>
<p>It may seem that this can be solved by having a registry of all the services and then
having the tests replace the services as needed.</p>
<pre>pre</pre>
<p>However, where does the serviceRegistry come from? If it is:
<em> <code>code</code>-ed up, the test has no chance to reset the services for testing.
</em>  a global look-up then the service returned is global as well (but resetting is easier, since
only one global variable exists to be reset).</p>
<p>The class above is hard to test since we have to change the global state:
<pre>pre</pre>
<h4 id="it-is-all-about-not-mixing-concerns_dependency-injection_passing-in-dependencies">Passing in Dependencies:</h4>
<p>Last, the dependency can be passed in.</p>
<pre>pre</pre>
<p>This is the preferred method since the code makes no assumptions about the origin of <code>code</code> and cares
instead about whoever created the class  responsible for passing it in. Since the creator of the
class should be different code than the user of the class, it separates the responsibility of
creation from the logic. This is dependency-injection in a nutshell.</p>
<p>The class above is testable, since in the test we can write:
<pre>pre</pre>
<p>Notice that no global variables were harmed in the writing of this test.</p>
<p>Angular comes with <a href="guide/di">dependency injection</a> built-in, making the right thing
easy to do, but you still need to do it if you wish to take advantage of the testability story.</p>
<h3 id="it-is-all-about-not-mixing-concerns_controllers">Controllers</h3>
<p>What makes each application unique is its logic, and the logic is what we would like to test. If the logic
for your application contains DOM manipulation, it will be hard to test. See the example
below:</p>
<pre>pre</pre>
<p>The code above is problematic from a testability point of view since it requires your test to have the right kind
of DOM present when the code executes. The test would look like this:</p>
<pre>pre</pre>
<p>In angular the controllers are strictly separated from the DOM manipulation logic and this results in
a much easier testability story as the following example shows:</p>
<pre>pre</pre>
<p>and the test is straight forward:</p>
<pre>pre</pre>
<p>Notice that the test is not only much shorter, it is also easier to follow what is happening. We say
that such a test tells a story, rather then asserting random bits which don&#39;t seem to be related.</p>
<h3 id="it-is-all-about-not-mixing-concerns_filters">Filters</h3>
<p><a href="api/ng.$filterProvider"><code>code</code></a> are functions which transform the data into a user readable
format. They are important because they remove the formatting responsibility from the application
logic, further simplifying the application logic.</p>
<pre>pre</pre>
<h3 id="it-is-all-about-not-mixing-concerns_directives">Directives</h3>
<p>Directives in angular are responsible for encapsulating complex functionality within custom HTML tags,
attributes, classes or comments. Unit tests are very important for directives because the components
you create with directives may be used throughout your application and in many different contexts.</p>
<h4 id="it-is-all-about-not-mixing-concerns_directives_simple-html-element-directive">Simple HTML Element Directive</h4>
<p>Let&#39;s start with an angular app with no dependencies.</p>
<pre>pre</pre>
<p>Now we can add a directive to our app.</p>
<pre>pre</pre>
<p>This directive is used as a tag <code>code</code>. It replaces the entire tag with the
template <code>code</code>. Now we are going to write a jasmine unit test to
verify this functionality. Note that the expression <code>code</code> times will also be evaluated in the rendered content.</p>
<pre>pre</pre>
<p>We inject the $compile service and $rootScope before each jasmine test. The $compile service is used
to render the aGreatEye directive. After rendering the directive we ensure that the directive has
replaced the content and &quot;lidless, wreathed in flame, 2 times&quot; is present.</p>
